# Kannada is one of the Dravidian languages spoken predominantly by people in southwestern India, especially in the state of Karnataka, with nearly 60 million speakers worldwide. The objective of this task is to predict the hand-written Kannada digits (0 to 9).
# The Training dataset contains 60.000 28x28 pixels grayscale images of different Kannada digits with the correct label associated with the image. Each pixel has a single pixel-value (0-255) associated with it; thus, the higher the value, the darker the pixel. The dataset is a subset of the data that was published in: Prabhu, Vinay Uday. "Kannada-MNIST: A new hand-written digits dataset for the Kannada language." As described in the article, the images included in the dataset were cleaned-cured by applying Gaussian-blur filter, adaptive thresholding, colour inversion, centring, chopping and other techniques.
